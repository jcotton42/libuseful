<h1>Searches</h1>

<p>This project includes/will include several searches. Among these will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Linear search</li>
<li>Binary search</li>
</ul>

<h2>Linear search</h2>

<p>Algorithm</p>

<pre>
for each item in the list
    if the item is the target
        return the position of the item
return the flag indicating that the target was not found
</pre>

<h2>Binary search</h2>

<p>Algorithm</p>

<pre>
set the upper bound to the length of the list
set the lower bound to 0
set the center to the length of the list divided by 2
while the difference between the upper and the lower bound is greater than 1
    if the target is the value at the center
        return the center position
    if the target is greater than the value at the center
        set the lower bound to the center
        recalculate the center position
        skip to the next iteration
    if the target is less than the value at the center
        set the upper bound to the center
        recalculate the center position
        skip to the next iteration
return the flag indicating that the target was not found
</pre>
